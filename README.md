What is the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm?
The Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm (BVA) is a seminal algorithm in quantum computing. It's often used as one of the first demonstrations of the power of quantum computation over classical computation, specifically the advantage offered by quantum parallelism and superposition.
